# plantasia
 Grow some plants and don't let them die - that kind of Arduino project

Using plots and charts in data visualization as well. Python files are heavily personalized for my use. I added some of my data in example_plant_data.csv for a start. The all_charts_imported.py file is the lazy way to try it out.

Used sensors:

DHT11 humidity and temperature sensor, SE012 photoresistor, FC-28 soil moisture sensor  
128x64 OLED, 1 channel relay module (5V), 5050 plant grow led strip lights (12V), piezo buzzer
